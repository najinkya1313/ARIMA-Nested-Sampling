# ðŸŒ€ Nested Sampling for ARIMA Model Selection

**A Python project to implement the Nested Sampling Algorithm for ARIMA Model selection with a focus on analyzing astronomical time-series data.**

---

## ðŸ“Œ Toâ€‘Do

1. **ARIMA Helper Class**  
   - Create a separate `ARIMA_helper_class` that includes a collection of standard ARIMA models.
   - The class should have built-in `data` and `order` stored as `self` parameters.

2. **Nested Sampler Enhancements**  
   - Add a method to the `NestedSampler` class to extract the **forecasted time series** using the parameters obtained.  
   - Add functionality to **visualize the forecasted series** alongside the original data.

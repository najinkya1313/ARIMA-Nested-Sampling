###A Python project to implement the Nested Sampling Algorithm for ARIMA Model selection

 To Do
1. Include a collection of standard ARIMA models as helper functions by creating a separate `ARIMA_helper_class`, with built-in `data` and `order` as self parameters.  
2. Extend the `NestedSampler` class with:
   - A method to extract the forecasted time series using the obtained parameters.
   - Functionality to visualize the forecasted series alongside the original data.
